## What is DomeCode?ü§î

[DomeCode](https://domecode.com) is a coding platform that unifies the coding experience by providing all relevant resources and tools in a single platform.
On DomeCode, you can practice in six languages including Rust, C, C++, Go, Java and Python. Learn, take notes, discuss stuff on the forum, connect with other developers, collaborate on projects with them, be a part of a developer community and way more!

This repository is the open-source codebase of [DomeCode](https://domecode.com/), a unified platform to learn code, practice, discuss, plan tasks, take notes, listen to music and more!

**The AGPL license allows the free use of this code-base in other free open-source projects.
However, the codebase is NOT free to use for paid projects. For paid projects, the use of this codebase would be paid as well.**

If anyone wants to share their experience using [DomeCode](https://domecode.com/), you can share it with me personally on Discord(zuck#9454) or send me an email at [`founder@domecode.com`](mailto:founder@domecode.com) üìß .

## Setup

Please refer to the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/The-Domecode/domecode-opensource/blob/master/contribution.md)

- Clone your fork of this repository.
- Run the migrations.
- Run this on your localhost.

**Things to take care of :**

- Have at the very least **some** level of prior knowledge in Django, enough to know how to make migrations, create super user and other very simple tasks. Recommended knowledge to substantially contribute in the project is, you should know how to work with Django Channels, build your own APIs, work with async Python, use Celery without running into issues all the time, know how web servers work in general and know how to properly use Docker. These are not the requirements per se but it's all recommended. 

- Use the `devmanage.py` command instead of `manage.py` command on development environments.

- This project uses `decouple` so make sure to make a local `.env` file in your root directory of the project containing all the variables with dummy values.

- The variables you should include are the ones with `config()` next to them in the `devmanage.py` file. If there's an error due to the missing value of an environment variable, it can be fixed with ease by passing in appropriate variables. It's pretty generic stuff. 



Here's a dummy .env file you can use:
```
SECRET_KEY="hk"
DB_HOST="abcd"
SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_KEY="hk"
SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET="hk"
SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_KEY="hk"
SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_SECRET="hk"
SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS="10"
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE="False"
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE="False"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="hc"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="hc"
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME="hc"
ADMIN_URL="admin"
JUDGE0_RAPID_API_KEY="abc"
HONEYBADGER_KEY="abc"
```

- If you want to do something involving the judge api, get your own api key from [here](https://rapidapi.com/hermanzdosilovic/api/judge0) and place that key in the ```JUDGE0_RAPID_API_KEY``` variable in .env

- Once you're done with that, you can start working on fixing the nitty gritty details, make improvements, finding issues and reporting them in the issues tab of this repository. Create PRs and have fun!

**Note : You should take note of that if you are working on the fork of this repository, you have to sync it before pushing changes to the fork and making a PR to this repo. How to sync changes made on this repo to your fork? Have a look at [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork).**

## Code Style

- Flake8 is used.

- Make sure the code has docstrings unless of course the code is pretty generic and is self explainable. If you came up with a solution by yourself on some sort of problem, make sure to include comments and/or docstring(s).

- The static files root is the `notes` directory which is weird and I'm aware of it but since the inception of this platform, the root static directory has been situated there and it's alright. `notes` app was the first app on this, anyway.

Note : In the repo's language stats, HTML and CSS have been disabled intentionally.

## Workflows on this repository

- Django CI is on the Private codebase. 
- Greetings Workflow
- Codeql Code Analysis workflow
- Python Lint
